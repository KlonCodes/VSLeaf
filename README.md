## Basic Instructions

- Should prompt you to install all extensions needed
- If not, they're in extensions.json

## Editor Instructions

- Pressing `Ctrl+S` will save the document and generate PDF in the **PDF** folder
- To check the generated PDF click on the PDF file. _(slow the first time)_
- If it shows **Error showing PDF** or in case of any inconvenience, just reload the browser or press `Ctrl+R`
- Do not delete the `devcontainer.json` file.

## Live Collaboration

- In addition to Git Sync, we can also live collaborate with an extension.
- Just click on the **Live Share** Sidebar button 

## PDF Viewer Dark Mode

- The pdf viewer will preview the pdf in Dark Mode by default if your OS is in Dark Mode.
- Just **comment** the noted lines from `./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to get rid of that.
